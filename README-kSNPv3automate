kSNPv3automate.py README:

(Before using kSNPv3automate.py it is suggested you place it into a folder that has been added to PATH
 This will save you having to navigate to the path it's saved in every time you want to use it.)

kSNPv3automate.py runs kSNP version 3.0 on all .fasta files in the inputted directory.
It should be used through command line with a command as follows:
$	kSNPv3automate.py -p <path of kSNP fasta files> -k <k-value you wish to use. Default is 51> -o <name you'd like to give the output folder created by kSNP, default is Results>

Note that kSNP version 3.0 is required, as is the tcsh shell. This script is intended for linux UBUNTU.






If you get an error where __author__, import etc are not recognised, it means the shebang (#!) statement isn't working, and you'll have to type "python" before the command. For example:
$	python GenomeTrimmer.py -p /home/austin/Genomes/Assembledpacbiow2miseq2015-03-26 -L 500 -f OLC*.fasta
